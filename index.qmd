[Building up your empirical stamina]{.large}

## Teaching and learning philosopy

-   [Instil:]{.salt}

-   [Intellectual discipline]{.saltinline}

    -   `Think critically and form your own opinions`

-   [Intellectual humility]{.saltinline}

    -   `Enough confidence to be comfortable in your own confusion`

- [Good citizenship]{.saltinline}

    -   `Acting ethically, altruistically,  responsibly and professionally`

- [Employability]{.saltinline}

    -   `Develop students into employable graduates` </span>

## Teaching and learning approach

-   Lectures will combine concepts and financial application with
    live-coding.
-   Come prepared and bring your laptop or device with web browser.
-   Interactive tutorials on QMS Remote Analytics Platform (Q-RaP).

## Feedback

-   Student *feedback* is important to me and I will provide this in a
    *professional* manner *conditional* on students behaving in a
    *professional and courteous* manner.
-   Each week there will be an anonymous poll where you can give
    feedback.
-   I am a NICE person when students act in a professional and
    courteous.
-   Otherwise I can be a fastidious scold.

## Active learning and the 15 minute rule

{{< video https://youtu.be/ZS8QHRtzcPg?si=HazZr5qaOdgpTk2X >}}

-   We will use the **15 minute** rule in this class.
-   If you encounter problems, spend 15 minutes troubleshooting on your
    own.
-   Make use of Google and StackOverflow to resolve the error
-   If your problem is not resolved after 15 minutes.
-  Ask for help by booking into a coding clinic or in practicals

## Plagiarism

-   I am trying to balance two competing perspectives:
    1.  Collaboration is good
    2.  Collaboration is cheating
-   In-class collaboration is good **to a point**.
-   You are always expected to write and submit your **own work**.
-   Asking for help is ok (after 15 minute rule),
-   Blindly copy from your peers (or published work) is not.

## To explain, predict or describe

- It is **wrongly** assumed that high explanatory = high
predictive power. 

- Explanatory models apply statistics to data to test **casual** hypothesis of theoretical constructs. 
- Prediction models apply statistics or data mining algorithms to data to predict future
observations. 
- The type of model uncertainty is different for each choice. 
- Explaining minimises *bias*, while prediction minimises *bias + variance* occasionally sacrificing theoretical accuracy for empirical precision.

## Building a model

-   How to use probability to do typical statistical modeling?

1.  Design the model (data story)

-   Formulated using theory from previous studies

2.  Condition on the data (update or estimate model)
3.  Evaluate the model (critique)

-   **And Repeat Until Satisified**

## Reading finance papers (the context)

-   You data story comes from reading research papers

#### Research project tips

-   What is the puzzle the paper is trying to solve?
-   How do they solve it?
-   Does it develop a new model?
-   Is it an existing technique with a new application?
-   Is it a data mining excercise?
-   Is the data of *good quality* ? Reliable, sample size etc.

## Reading finance papers

### Research project tips

-   Have model assumptions been validly checked and critiqued?
-   Are results interpreted sensibly or exaggerated?
-   Do results actually address the questions posed?
-   Have conclusions been drawn appropriate or overstated?

## Model comparison

.pull-left-1.large\[Instead of falsifying a null model, compare
meaningful models.\]

.pull-right-2\[ .large\[Basic problems\] - Overfitting or Data
Snooping - Causal inference - Ockham's razor is silly - Information
theory is less silly - AIC, cross-validation - Must distinguish
prediction from inference\]

## Applying financial time series econometrics

-   Financial time series econometrics is concerned with theory and
    practice of asset valuation over time
-   It has similarity to other time series analysis but has some added
    uncertainty.
-   FTS analysis must deal with the ever-changing business and economic
    enviroment and the fact that volatility is not directly observed.

## Applying financial time series econometrics

**Describe**

1.  Estimating parameters of well-defined probability models that
    describe the behaviour of financial time series.

**Explain**

2.  Testing hypotheses on how financial markets generate the series of
    interest.

**Predict**

3.  Forecast future realisations of the financial time series.
